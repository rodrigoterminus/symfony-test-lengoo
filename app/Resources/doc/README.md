# Symfony Coding Challenge

Hi Rodrigo!

Thanks for taking your time to work on this Symfony Coding Challenge.

Ideally this test should take a couple of hours. But feel free to take as much time as you need. Quality is more important than speed. Latest delivery though is in one week starting now.

This coding challenge will show us some of your skills. And you get to know our work flow as well. The solution of the challenge is not too hard. So you can focus on technology and code. Show us what you got! ;-)

This is your Demo! Overperforming is very welcome!

### Todo:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a new dev branch.
3. Use many commits so we can see your progress.
4. After finishing your work, create a Pull Request from the master
5. Be ready to answer questions

### Requirements:
* Write PHP 7 valid code
* Use Symfony 3.x
* Write Unit tests where applicable/necessary
* Write your code in English
* Use migration files

### Optional:
* Comment your code if necessary

### Your Task:
Build a simple application form. 

#### Front page:
On the front page applicants can insert their name, email address and attach a document.

On submit an email is sent to the applicant with something like "Thanks for your application! we will get back to you as fast as we can.".

All textual data is saved in a MySql database, the attachment on the file system.

#### Admin page

This is a secured area. After logging in (user: lengoo, password: lengoo) we see a List with all applications. By clicking on one you can see the details from the form, the creation time and you download the attachment. And there is a Logout.

#### Bonus points:
* Clean code
* Create a form class
* Save the location of the applicant. Don't ask them for it. Try to get it from the request object. Maybe use a suitable library.

### Evaluation criteria:
This is what we look at - among other things:
* The program needs to run. Please provide **short** setup instructions.
* Testing
* Usage of Composer
* All code in UTF-8

We are not searching for the best frontend design. Focus on code.

Good luck!
